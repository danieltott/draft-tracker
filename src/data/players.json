Brock Osweiler folded once again under the lights. Look for Kizer to start in Cleveland sooner than later. His physical skills alone should help him become a solid garbage-time option. ",

His usage could be inconsistent week to week, but in best ball leagues, you’ll have plenty of other options to cover those weeks while still getting the boost from the weeks that the Saints make Kamara one of their main matchups to exploit. Kamara also offers injury upside if Mark Ingram or Adrian Peterson miss time. ",

Hogan scored four times last year and had another 100-yard receiving game. The Patriots passing game is crowded, but Hogan should be able to give you 4-5 scoring weeks and a very late round pick price again this year with the gameplan of the week nature of the Patriots offense.",
